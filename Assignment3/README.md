## [Assignment description](./assignment-03.pdf)

We understood the task as:
- Implement missing classes based on the available interfaces
- Create a MySQL database containing the data types using the given scripts
- Create connection between the application and the database
- Test the system with the knowledge we have so far

Optionally, peer programming can be utilized.

## Process
```diff
- TODO
```

We discussed whether to split up the assignment or do it in pairs. As we are only two members, ...

We wanted to cover most, or all, of the strategies we have learned so far in class. Therefore, this became our strategy.

### Strategy
```diff
- TODO
```

- Utilize pair programming in part X of the assignment
- Do some Test-Driven development
- Unit Test
- Integration Test
- ?

### Setup
We followed the provided code in the assignment repository ([commit](https://github.com/Hold-Krykke-BA/Test/commit/1a21b64df26c98dc6cb395f8d8ce458771d56ed5#diff-bbd6f8cf2e618b335ebcaa545470413e4db5304dc5ba229858d647983c8061d6)) and coded in Java. We used the supplied dependencies found in the `pom.xml` file but updated them as we found fit.

```diff
- actually do this
```

## Result
```diff
- TODO
```

## Reflection
```diff
- TODO
```

This worked well
- ?

That not so much
- The assignment was a bit unclear
- ?
